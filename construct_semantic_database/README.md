\# Semantic Suggestions



This folder contains the implementation of the \*\*Semantic Suggestion Mechanism\*\* powered by our \*Semantic Distortion Database\*.



\## Overview

The Semantic Suggestion Mechanism retrieves human-readable repair hints for distorted decompiled code lines.  

It leverages a curated database of decompilation artifacts paired with their source-level semantic corrections, retrieved via embedding-based similarity and distortion-aware filtering.



\## Status

⚠️ \*\*Note\*\*: The code, database, and retrieval pipeline will be released \*\*once the paper is accepted\*\*.
