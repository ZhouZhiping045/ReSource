\# Control Flow Prediction



This folder contains the implementation of the \*\*Control Flow Prediction Module\*\* used in our paper \*"ReSource: Towards Source-like Recovery from Optimized and Obfuscated Binaries"\*.



\## Overview

The Control Flow Prediction Module is designed to reconstruct high-level control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals) from decompiled functions.  

It is trained on pairs of decompiled code and their corresponding source-level control-flow sequences, enabling accurate recovery even under compiler optimizations and obfuscations.



\## Status

⚠️ \*\*Note\*\*: The code, pretrained models, and training scripts will be released \*\*once the paper is accepted\*\*.
